synembtrack

Synthetic data â†’ Embedding-based instance segmentation â†’ Cell association / trajectory extraction
A lightweight, research-oriented toolbox for tracking motile bacteria in 2D microscopy videos.

Features

Synthetic dataset builder for moderately dense, swimming bacteria

Embedding-based instance segmentation pipeline (EmbedSeg-style)

Frame-to-frame association with IoU & distance heuristics

Trajectory export to CSV/Parquet and basic visualization utilities

Reproducible project layout (src-layout packaging, scripts, configs)

Note: This repo targets research & reproducibility first. APIs are intentionally simple and avoid complex CLI with many parameters.

Installation
1) Create environment (recommended)
# conda (example)
conda create -n synembtrack python=3.10 -y
conda activate synembtrack

2) Editable install
# from the repository root
pip install -e .


This installs synembtrack in development mode so you can edit source under src/ and use it immediately.

Quick start (5 min)
Smoke test
python -c "import synembtrack, importlib; print('synembtrack ok')"

Minimal workflow outline

Prepare data
Put a few microscopy frames (TIF/PNG) under a project folder, e.g.:

projects/demo_2Dsuspension_25C/
  â”œâ”€ images/
  â””â”€ (optional) masks/     # if you already have instance masks


Run segmentation & save instance masks
Use the example in scripts/ to segment images into per-frame instance masks.

# example: segmentation pipeline (adjust to your script names)
python scripts/seg_run_demo.py \
  --project projects/demo_2Dsuspension_25C


Associate & export trajectories
Link instances across frames into tracks and export CSV.

python scripts/assoc_run_demo.py \
  --project projects/demo_2Dsuspension_25C \
  --out projects/demo_2Dsuspension_25C/trajs.csv


Visualize tracks (optional)
Overlay tracks on raw images for sanity check.

python tools/visualize_tracks.py \
  --images projects/demo_2Dsuspension_25C/images \
  --traj   projects/demo_2Dsuspension_25C/trajs.csv \
  --out    projects/demo_2Dsuspension_25C/vis


The exact script names/options may differ in your repo; start from the examples in scripts/ and tools/. We intentionally keep interfaces simple (few required args).

Configuration

Global/data presets live in configs/.

Project-specific overrides can be placed under projects/<name>/config.(toml|yaml).

Typical parameters include pixel size, FPS, association radius, IoU threshold, etc.

If a parameter table CSV is used (for simulation/sweeps), ensure integer-type keys like NperiSmpl are handled as integers.

Outputs

Masks: multi-page TIF or per-frame label TIF (0 background, 1..K instances)

Trajectories: CSV/Parquet with columns like
TIME_frame, TRACK_ID, X_(com), Y_(com), bbox_w, bbox_h, area_mask, ...

Diagnostics: optional figures/PNG overlays under projects/<name>/vis/

Known limitations

The demo is tuned for 2D swimming bacteria; dense biofilms or extreme overlaps need further tuning.

Association is currently heuristic (IoU + distance). Long gaps or fast motion may require model-based linking.

Training code and pretrained weights are minimal; bring your own model if needed.

Roadmap

 Add tiny unit tests for I/O & association logic

 Provide a single quickstart script that runs end-to-end on demo images

 Publish docs (MkDocs) with troubleshooting and FAQs

 Optional: release pretrained weights for the demo

Pull requests are welcome!
Please keep code style simple and add short English comments/docstrings.
For features with many parameters, prefer config files over long CLI flags.
